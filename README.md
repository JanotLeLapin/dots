# Janot's dotfiles

My configuration files for NixOS, River, Neovim, and more.

## Setup

*I'm assuming you're running NixOS*

Clone this repository as your home directory, and run the utility `setup.sh` script I wrote because I'm lazy.

The script **WILL DELETE** your existing NixOS config, so be sure to have a backup.
